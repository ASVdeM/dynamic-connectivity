# dynamic-connectivity

This repo was created after I saw Daniel Lawland's Dynamic Connectivity repo at https://github.com/danlawand/dynamic-connectivity/tree/main, and decided to try to create something similar.

Most of the code available here has been adapted from the original repo, as I do not have a similar grasp of Data Structures as Daniel.

The main goal is to implement a dynamic forest in the C programming language.
